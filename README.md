### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Linh. I'm a backend / fullstack software developer and I'm from Viet Nam. 

Two and a half years ago, I made a career transition from a publisher engagement manager to become a developer. My wish is to build something that is actually useful to people, because I do believe that technology is the future.
