### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Linh. I'm a backend / fullstack software developer and I'm from Hoi An, Viet Nam. 

Two and a half years ago, I made a career transition from a publisher engagement manager to become a developer. My wish is to build something that is actually useful to people, because I do believe that technology is the future.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal project called **Easy Recipes**
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more on **React JS**
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a **perfect job opportunity** to start off my career in Spain
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **anything**, please!
